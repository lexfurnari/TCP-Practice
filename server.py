# Server for a simple TCP-like semi-reliable protocol on top of UDP. 
#
# What it does: This version expects the first 8 bytes of each packet to contain
# a sequence number and a magic number. The magic number is completely ignored.
# Every time a packet arrives, an 8-byte ACK is sent back, consisting of the
# magic number 0xAAAAAAAA followed by the sequence number just received. 
# 
# What it doesn't do: There is no real attempt to detect missing packets, send
# NACKs, use cumulative acknowledgements, or do any sort of flow-control. The
# code in datasink.py will keep track of duplicates and rearrange mis-ordered
# packets, so we don't need to worry about that here.
#
# Run the program like this:
#   python3 server.py 1.2.3.4 6000
# This will listen for data on UDP 1.2.3.4:6000. The IP address should be the IP
# for our own host.
