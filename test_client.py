# Stop-and-wait client for a simple TCP-like semi-reliable protocol on top of UDP.
#
# What it does: This implements the stop-and-wait protocol, mostly. It sends one UDP packet,
# waits for an ACK, sends one more, waits for an ACK, etc. A sequence number is
# included in each packet, so the server can detect duplicates, detect missing
# packets, and sort any mis-ordered packets back into the correct order. A
# "magic" integer (0xBAADCAFE) is also included with each packet, for no reason
# at all (you can replace it with something else, or remove it entirely).
#
# What it doesn't do: There are no NACKs or timeouts, so if any packet is lost,
# the protocol will deadlock. The ACK numbers are also completely ignored, so if
# there packets get duplicated in the network, things will probably go haywire.
#
# Run the program like this:
#   python3 client_saw.py 1.2.3.4 6000
# This will send data to a UDP server at IP address 1.2.3.4 port 6000.
